      Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway.

      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
      <ol>
        <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li> Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li> Last Chance, CO</li>
        <li> Why, AZ</li>
        <li> Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
      <blockquote cite="http://">
        Passing cars,<br>
        When you can't see,<br>
        May get you a glimpse,<br>
        Of eternity.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars!

    <p>
      My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
      Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
          <li>cell phone</li>
          <li>iPod</li>
          <li>
            <ol>
              <li>digital camera - Canon</li>
              <li>digital camera - Sony</li>
              <li>digital camera - Konica</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
       Just the essentials.
      As Lao Tzu would have said, <q cite="">A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
