      My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
      Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
      cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials.
      As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
