      My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
      Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
      cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials.
      As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, when you can't see,
      May get you a glimpse of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars!

      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
      Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ, and Truth or Consequences, NM.
